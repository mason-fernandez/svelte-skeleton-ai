Let X and Y be any two sets, and let |X| and |Y| be their sizes. What is the size of each of the \nfollowing sets? If you cannot determine the answer exactly, try to give upper and lower bounds.\na. X union Y = X+Y-(X intersection Y)\nb. X x Y = X*Y\nc. X^n = X^n\nd. X* = 0 for an empty set, 1 for a set of one, and infinite for a set >1\n2. Give the ML type corresponding to each of the following sets:\na. {true,false} bool\nb. {true,false} -> {true,false} fn: bool -> bool\nc. {(true , true) , (true , false) , ( false , true) , ( false , false)} bool * bool\nNote for #2, you are given a set in each part of the problem. Write the ML type constructor that \ncorresponds to that set. The curly braces are not ML records–they're just sets.\n4. Suppose there are three variables X, Y, and Z with these types: X: integer that is divisible by 3 Y: \ninteger that is divisible by 12 Z: integer. For each of the following assignments, knowing nothing about \nthe values of the variables except their types, answer whether a language system can tell before run-\nning the program whether the assignment is safe? Why or why not?\nZ least strict, then Y/12, then X/3\na. X := Y, safe because anything divisible by three is also divisible by 12\nb. X := X safe because its the same type\nc. Y := Y + 1 not safe because adding one may make it no longer divisible by three\nd. Z := X safe because x is a subset of z\ne. X := Z not safe because not all integers are divisible by 3\nf.
